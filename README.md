# Web-Chat-Application

This is a web chat application currently set to run on a local machine. Both the server application and the client application are available. 
If you wish to run this project simple clone the two projects "ClientApp" and "ServerApp" and run instances of each. 
Then hit the "Start server" button on the server applcation followed by the "Connect" button on the same application. Then hit the "Connect"
button on the client application and then you are good to go.

This was a very simple project I have created in my leisure to understand adn implement a synchronous server and a synchronous client using
Sockets (How basic socket communication works).
